# robotling_lib
["robotling"](https://github.com/teuler/robotling) is a simple circuit board to control small robots, mainly for educational purpose. This repository contains robotling-related hardware and software libraries.

> Note: _Several of the drivers are based on code developed by [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit); for details on source, copyright, original authors etc., see information in respective file header._

For an overview of some of the supported hardware, see ["Sensoren etc."](https://github.com/teuler/robotling/wiki/Sensoren-etc) (in German).

> Note: _Some of the drivers (e.g. [TeraRanger Evo Mini](https://www.terabee.com/shop/lidar-tof-range-finders/teraranger-evo-mini/), which requires an UART port to access its full functionality) are not compatible to the current robotling board._
